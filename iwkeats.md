# IWAKUNI EATS
---

##### I am actually quite embarrassed that I can have a specific section for food.  What can I say, I *love* to eat!  Learning of new *retsutoran* (restaurants) to try happened either through word of mouth or just exploring the the corners of Iwakuni.  There is still so much to explore within this little *machi* (town), but that is a challenge I am willing to accept.

### Tips when dining out:
##### 1. Carry __yen__ at *all times*!  You can withdraw yen from ATMs at either 7-11s, Post Offices, and local grocery stores.
##### 2. Ask for an *Eigo* (Engligh) menu!  However, it's _not_ guaranteed they'll have one. 
##### 3. Say *Sumimasusen* to get the employee's attention if there's no button to press when you're ready to order.
##### 4. When finished ordering, say *Igo desu*, it means *that's all*.
##### 5. If you need the bill *split*, say *Betsu betsu, onegaishimasu* (split please).
