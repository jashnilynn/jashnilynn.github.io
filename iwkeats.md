# IWAKUNI EATS
---

##### I am actually quite embarrassed that I can have a specific section for food.  What can I say, I *love* to eat!  Learning of new *retsutoran* (restaurants) to try happened either through word of mouth or just exploring the the corners of Iwakuni.  There is still so much to explore within this little *machi* (town), but that is a challenge I am willing to accept.

### Tips when dining out:
##### 1. Carry **yen** at **all times**!  You can withdraw yen from ATMs at either 7-11s, Post Offices, and local grocery stores.
##### 2. Ask for an **Eigo** (Engligh) menu!  However, it's _not_ guaranteed they'll have one. 
##### 3. Say **Sumimasusen** to get the employee's attention if there's no button to press when you're ready to order.
##### 4. When finished ordering, say **Igo desu**, it means *that's all*.
##### 5. If you need the bill *split*, say **Betsu betsu, onegaishimasu** (split please).

### Coco Ichibanya
##### Address: 1 Chome-16-17 Minamiiwakunimachi, Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture 740-0034 (near Youme Town).  1 Chome-3-14 Marifumachi, Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture 740-0018 (near Iwakuni Eki (train station).
##### Japanese Curry!  For some this restuarant is overrated, however for the price and amount of food, this restaurant will always be one of my quick go to.  My favorite dish is either the **crispy chicken** or the **chicken katsu** with cheese and spice level 3.  Be careful when choosing the level of spiceness, because depending on who is the cook of the day --the spice level can vary.  Level 10 is the highest, if you were to reach this level, props to you!  *If you're not feeling too hungry, get the **half order** of your usual --150g of rice,curry, and a drink on the side!* **Eigo (English) menu is avialable and either yen or debit card is acceptable**
