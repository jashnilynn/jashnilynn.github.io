# IWAKUNI EATS
---

##### I am actually quite embarrassed that I can have a specific section for food.  What can I say, I *love* to eat!  Learning of new *retsutoran* (restaurants) to try happened either through word of mouth or just exploring the the corners of Iwakuni.  There is still so much to explore within this little *machi* (town), but that is a challenge I am willing to accept.

### Tips when dining out:
##### 1. Carry **yen** at **all times**!  You can withdraw yen from ATMs at either 7-11s, Post Offices, and local grocery stores.
##### 2. Ask for an **Eigo** (Engligh) menu!  However, it's _not_ guaranteed they'll have one. 
##### 3. Say **Sumimasusen** to get the employee's attention if there's no button to press when you're ready to order.
##### 4. When finished ordering, say **Igo desu**, it means *that's all*.
##### 5. If you need the bill *split*, say **Betsu betsu, onegaishimasu** (split please).

### Coco Ichibanya
##### Address: 1 Chome-16-17 Minamiiwakunimachi, Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture 740-0034
##### Japanese Curry! For some this restuarant is overrated, however for the price and amount of food, this restaurant will always be one of my quick go to.  *If you're not feeling too hungry, get the **half order** of your usual --150g of rice and a drink on the side!*
