# IWAKUNI EATS
---

##### I am actually quite embarrassed that I can have a specific section for food.  What can I say, I *love* to eat!  Learning of new *retsutoran* (restaurants) to try happened either through word of mouth or just exploring the the corners of Iwakuni.  There is still so much to explore within this little *machi* (town), but that is a challenge I am willing to accept.

### Tips when dining out:
##### 1. Carry **yen** at **all times**!  You can withdraw yen from ATMs at either 7-11s, Post Offices, and local grocery stores.
##### 2. Ask for an **Eigo** (Engligh) menu!  However, it's _not_ guaranteed they'll have one. 
##### 3. Say **Sumimasusen** to get the employee's attention if there's no button to press when you're ready to order.
##### 4. When finished ordering, say **Igo desu**, it means *that's all*.
##### 5. If you need the bill *split*, say **Betsu betsu, onegaishimasu** (split please).

##### Address: 1 Chome-3-14 Marifumachi, Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture 740-0018 (near Iwakuni Eki (train station).
##### Hours: Open everyday: 1100 - 0000
##### Japanese Curry!  For some this restuarant is overrated, however for the price and amount of food, this restaurant will always be one of my quick go to.  My favorite dish is either the **crispy chicken** or the **chicken katsu** with cheese and spice level 3.  Be careful when choosing the level of spiceness, because depending on who is the cook of the day --the spice level can vary.  Level 10 is the highest, if you were to reach this level, props to you!  *If you're not feeling too hungry, get the **half order** of your usual --150g of rice,curry, and a drink on the side!* **Eigo (English) menu is avialable and either yen or debit card is acceptable**

### Kinba
##### Address: 1 Chome-10-17 Imazumachi, Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture 740-001  (park across the street in ticketed parking lot)
##### Hours: Sunday - Saturday 1100 - 1430 *&* 1700 - 2300.  *Closed on Tuesdays*!
##### Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake)!  If you like to have a show before digging into your food, this place is up your alley.  I'm not talking about a circus show, but rather the cooks smoothing out the batter, making the egg golden brown, stacking ingredients on top of each other, and the best part --having to flip everything all together!  This dish can either be indulged by one person or can be shared between two.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is unique with a book shelf stacked with manga (Japanese anime) for the customers to read.  Hang out, watch the show, and don't forget to order a drink with tapioca!  **Eigo (Engligh) menu is avialable and either yen or debit card is acceptable**
