# An island girl 

born and raised on the beautiful island of Guam.
Set some new roots in 2008 in the beautiful Pacific North West, Washington state.
Since then I have met and married my husband, 
lived up my youthful years in San Diego,
and now I am making the most of living in a foreign country -- Iwakuni, Japan.
